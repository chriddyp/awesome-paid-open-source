### FAQ and Key Terms

#### Dual licensing

Quote from "[Open Hardware Business Models](http://www.osbr.ca/ojs/index.php/osbr/article/view/570/523)"

> The first license is a GPL-like license, which is free but forces users to disclose the source code of any modified version of the original design. The second is a commercial license, which has a fee but allows buyers to conceal the source code of any modified version.
